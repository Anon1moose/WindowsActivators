# WindowsActivators
This is the source code for a batch file for activating windows 10.
this is an automated way of activating and is not a virus so don't worry about the prompts that windows defender gives you, do feel free to view the prompts and learn why.
first you need to disable windows defender for a short while and you need to keep internet connection active.
you can also run the batch file and then go to windows security and select allow on device if you are lazy like me, windows will likely name it as a virus and label it critical, high or severe but don't worry about that.
copy the code from the activator file staring at line 5 (@echo...) and ending at shutdown...
open a new text document and paste the code to it.
go to "file" and select "save as" and save it as something along the lines of "Windows 10 Activator.bat" or "Activator.bat" just something you wont get confused with something else and add the suffix ".bat" and set the document type to "all files" 
locate you batch file and run it as an administrator and let it do it's thing and it should show a box at the end saying succesfully installed.
